# Project Name: Android OCR Translator

## Project Info
- Date: July 2025 - present

## Overview
This ongoing project is an Android application that uses Optical Character Recognition (OCR) and translation models from Google's Machine Learning (ML) Kit to recognize text in images stored on the user's mobile device and translate it into 20+ languages. I designed this app to help people learn new languages, like non-English speakers learning English for the first time.
